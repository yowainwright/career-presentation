The image above diagrams of most of the roles involved in content products for 2016. 

Product is placed in the middle because it negotiates workflow & new products for the different teams.

User Experience  work on what a content's customer does from interactions to analytics. They are also important when negotiating a site's information architecture.

Design develops the siteâ€™s identity & look as well as negotiate art direction with content editors & writers.


Backend development focuses on the rendering data objects from the content editor input level

Frontend development starts when the data is massaged from data objects to the rendering of a page.

Writer is a loose term as content can be imagery, video or word articles

Content Editors deal with content insertion into the product.

Not pictured are sales/ad & core analytics people & both are important. Sales & ad people negotiate ad deals & affiliate content deals. Analytics people record & document the product.

Front End Engineers are tasked with working with other teams to render captivating content & business oriented products.

Captivating content such as videos, collections, streams, galleries, quizzes & articles must be rendered in an exciting yet optimized manner.

Besides content, Front End engineers support testing, analytics, ad & affiliate goals.

Relevancy, content in a free era

Content is largely viewed as a free experience 

Customers expect great products for free how they want it.

Businesses require great content to drive customer awareness.

Customers enjoy marketing but on an increasingly invisible level.

Front End Engineers are tasks with creating the happy medium or that great product & business goals.

Customers can consume, share & spin off good content easily.

What does this mean for the future?

For front end engineers

Front End engineers are currently in demand, however it is an extremely fast-pasted industry. What I learned as innovation last year in a conference has a shelf life of about 1 year at its current pace.

With code camps & quick fix coding schools, the industry is saturated with junior engineers.

The role should be changing over the next years to no longer focus on visibility but most likely logical solutions with the information architecture. 

For content teams

It is an exciting & innovative climate of constantly changing ways to deliver content.

Most innovations don't involve a business price tag so businesses are expected to incorporate these tech innovations by users but don't get an obvious return on investment. 

This makes the financial aspects of content tumultuous.

// Slide 8


For a younger generation

Younger generations are consuming products beyond they were often designed for. They're hacking the system so to speak. With apps like Snapchat & Messenger - the tech community is often surprised by the use of the product. For those seeking a career in content, it will be innovative & most likely involve currently unthought-of of ways to captivate an audience ... or we can just keep creating memes.
